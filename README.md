## Framework used

- REACT Framework

- App.js :- contains code for routes to the components, API calls, and rendering elements of App. For example, it is used for connecting Front-end app with Back-end express API. It contains various REST-ful routes for Create, Retrieving (Read), Update, and Delete the information of customers, work requests, and technicians.

REACT Components:

- Header.js - is used for rendering a header and navigation bar
- Home.js - for displaying landing page
- AllCustomers.js - is used for showing the list of all customers
- CustomerDetail.js - is used for showing the details of each customer and editing the customer information.
- AllTechnicians.js - is used for showing the list of all technicians
- TechnicianDetail.js - is used for showing the details of each technician and editing the handyman information.
- AllRequests.js - is used for showing all work requests with requested start-date and end-dates
- RequestDetail.js - is used for editing the work request
- Signup.js - is used for signing up the users/customers
- Login.js - is used for authentication and user login

## App Components

- App:- This will make the initial data pull and include functionality, React Router
- Header:- This will render the header including the navigation bar
- Footer:- This will render the footer

- Handyman should be able to chatt or call customer's phone using an App

## Issues and Resolutions

ERROR: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined"

Details:-
Faced an issue with one of the routes - postman wasn't returning "id" values from the Requests table. and front-end was throwing "TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined". From App.js, I was making an API call to get all the work-requests. (postman wasn't pulling "id" which is the primary key).

Front-end code:
render() {
const allRequests = this.props.requests.map((request) => {
console.log("allRequests- request.id", request.id);
return (

<Link to={/requestsC/${request.id}}> {request.req_desc} Delete 
);
});

- RESOLUTION: After using the "Atributes" in router.get(), fixed an issue -->

// GET ALL Requests in RequestController of Back-end App

router.get("/", async (req, res) => {
let requests = await RequestModel.findAll({
attributes: [
"id",
"req_desc",
"req_start_date",
"req_end_date",
"user_id",
"tech_id",
],
});
res.json({ requests });
});

## Next Steps: "PostMVP"

- Implement addional functionalities - to search technician by work categories, cities, image profile, security(authentication) etc.
- Handyman should be able to chatt or call customer's phone using an App
